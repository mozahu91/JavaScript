What is programming?
Programming is like writing a list of instructions to the computer so it can do cool stuff with your information.

Programs can't yet make your bed, but they can do math, keep track of your bank account, or send a message to a friend.

To do any of these actions, the program needs an input. You can ask for input with a prompt.

Use the prompt command to ask the user where they are from. Check out the examples above for how to do this!

Data Types I & II: Numbers & Strings
Data comes in various types. You have used two already!

a. numbers are quantities, just like you're used to. You can do math with them.

b. strings are sequences of characters, like the letters a-z, spaces, and even numbers. These are all strings: "Ryan", "4" and "What is your name?" Strings are extremely useful as labels, names, and content for your programs.

To make a number in your code, just write a number as numerals without quotes: 42, 190.12334.

To write a string, surround words with quotes: "What is your name?"
